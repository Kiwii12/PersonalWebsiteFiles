            This website was made using the notes given in Dr. Weiss's Gui class, some help from the local team CSS expert (Dan), and with the tutorials from:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://www.mcs.sdsmt.edu/csc468/">Dr. Weiss's class website</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/">http://www.w3schools.com/css/</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp</a></li>
            </ul>

            Some images on this website have been taken from Google. According to the website <a href="http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/copyright-fair-use-and-how-it-works-for-online-images/">"http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/copyright-fair-use-and-how-it-works-for-online-images/"</a>, these few pictures were all taken from public domain, and thus are usable in this project.
        </p>
        <p>
            The CrowdControl image was made by Daniel Andrus, and I have the permission of the company Bowtaps to use this image. I have gotten permission from the five members of the Bowtaps team to use their pictures on this website, and to link to their respective pages.
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, an image in a link to GitHub. This image from taken from a GitHub repo under the protections outlined in this website: <a href="https://github.com/logos">https://github.com/logos.</a> It explicitly says that this image may be used in this way: "Use the Mark in social buttons to link to your GitHub profile or project."

            This website is simply a school project. It should not be taken seriously, and is in no way ment to harm anyone's reputation. The only goal of this website was to meet the requirements of <a href="http://www.mcs.sdsmt.edu/csc468/Assignments/PA2/PA2-homepage.pdf">http://www.mcs.sdsmt.edu/csc468/Assignments/PA2/PA2-homepage.pdf.</a> This project was assigned by Dr. Weiss in Spring of 2016. The site that it is hosted on is also likely to go away in the near feature.
