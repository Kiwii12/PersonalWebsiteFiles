            Hello, My name is Johnathan Ackerman. Most people call me Johnny. I am a Computer Science Major at the School of Minds and Technology. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2012, I graduated from Central High School here in Rapid City. In fact, I've spent most of my life here in Rapid. Though, you might not know it by asking me, because I have no sense of direction.

            Throughout my college career, I have taken many courses and worked on many projects. Many of these projects can be found at my GitHub account <a href="https://github.com/Kiwii12">here: <img src="images/GitHub-Mark-32px.png"></a>
        </p>

        <p>
            Some of the courses I have taken include:
            <ul>
                <li>CSC-415 Introduction to Robotics</li>
                <li>CSC-441 Networking/Data Communications</li>
                <li>CSC-470 Software Engineering</li>
                <li>CSC-433 Computer Graphics</li>
                <li>CSC-314 Assembly Language</li>
            </ul> 
            just to name a few.
        </p>


        <p>
            I have also been lucky enough to have been apart of some pretty cool projects. Including:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/Kiwii12/CSC433_Program1_Pong">A Pong Game /with an AI</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/Kiwii12/CSC433_Program3_SolarSystem">A Simulated representation of our Solar System</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/Kiwii12/Diagnostic-Shell">A Custom Shell.</a>(not as good as the terminal but close)</li>
            </ul>
        Of these projects, the Pong program is my favorite. I really enjoy GUI applications.

            These are some web-based team projects that I have been apart of. <br/>
            Please Note: <br/>
            Both of these projects are hosted by the school and run on school based databases, 
            meaning they could go down at any time
