                Hello, My name is Johnathan Ackerman. Most people call me Johnny. I am a Computer Science Major at the School of Minds and Technology. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2012, I graduated from Central High School here in Rapid City. In fact, I've spent most of my life here in Rapid. Though, you might not know it by asking me, because I have no sense of direction.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thoughout my college career, I have taken many courses and worked on many projects. Many of these projects can be found <a href="https://github.com/Kiwii12">at my GitHub account here.</a>
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Some of the courses I have taken include:
                <ul>
                    <li>CSC-415 Introduction to Robotics</li>
                    <li>CSC-441 Networking/Data Communications</li>
                    <li>CSC-470 Software Engineering</li>
                    <li>CSC-433 Computer Graphics</li>
                    <li>CSC-314 Assembly Language</li>
                </ul> 
                just to name a few.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
                I have also been lucky enough to have been apart of some pretty cool projects. Including:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/Kiwii12/CSC433_Program1_Pong">A Pong Game /with an AI</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/Kiwii12/CSC433_Program3_SolarSystem">A Simulated representation of our Solor System</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/Kiwii12/Diagnostic-Shell">A Custom Shell.</a>(not as good as the terminal but close)</li>
                </ul>
            Of these projects, the Pong program is my favorite. I really enjoy gui applications.
            </p>

            <p>
                These are some web based team projects that I have been apart of. <br/>
                Please Note: <br/>
                Both of these projects are hosted by the school and run on school based datebases, 
                meaning they could go down at any time
                <br/>
